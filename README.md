## üìÇ Repository Contents

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **asu_scrapper_doi (1).ipynb** | Scrapes article links/DOIs from the ASU Library. This notebook generates the URLs/links from which PDFs can later be downloaded. |
| **asu_pdf_extraction (2).ipynb** | Downloads PDFs for publishers where direct PDF download links are available. Handles straightforward cases where the PDF is directly accessible. |
| **failed_pdf_extractor.ipynb** | Handles failed cases from `asu_pdf_extraction`. Opens the article link in Safari and attempts to scrape the PDF when direct download fails. |
| **pdf_extraction_ieee_dash.ipynb** | Extracts PDFs from IEEE Xplore (and similar) links obtained via the ASU Library. |
| **pdf_extraction_onlinewiley.ipynb** | Extracts PDFs from OnlineWiley publisher links. |
| **sciencedirect_pdf_extraction (2).ipynb** | Extracts PDFs from ScienceDirect publisher links. |

## üìù Workflow

1. **Scrape DOIs/Links**  
   Use `asu_scrapper_doi (1).ipynb` to scrape article links using DOIs from the ASU Library.

2. **Direct PDF Extraction**  
   Run `asu_pdf_extraction (2).ipynb` to download PDFs where direct download links exist.

3. **Handle Failed Downloads**  
   If some PDFs fail to download, for either of the publishers mentioned in `asu_pdf_extraction (2).ipynb`, run `failed_pdf_extractor.ipynb` to open the links in Safari and scrape PDFs manually.

4. **Publisher-Specific Extraction**  
   For publisher-specific links (IEEE, Wiley, ScienceDirect, etc.), run the respective notebooks:
   - `pdf_extraction_ieee_dash.ipynb`
   - `pdf_extraction_onlinewiley.ipynb`
   - `sciencedirect_pdf_extraction (2).ipynb`
