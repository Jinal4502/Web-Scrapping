    "ScienceDirect PDF Extraction and Download Script\n",
    "1. Purpose\n",
    "This script automates the process of:\n",
    "Collecting article titles, Scopus IDs, and ScienceDirect links from multiple text/JSON files.\n",
    "Cleaning and normalizing those links to canonical ScienceDirect article URLs.\n",
    "Comparing extracted entries with an Excel file of SCOPUS IDs to remove unwanted records.\n",
    "Automating the download of PDFs from ScienceDirect using AppleScript on macOS with Safari.\n",
    "2. Library Imports\n",
    "The script imports:\n",
    "requests, concurrent.futures – for HTTP requests and parallel processing.\n",
    "pandas, numpy, PyPDF2, tqdm – for data handling, PDF reading, and progress bars.\n",
    "selenium, undetected_chromedriver – for potential browser automation.\n",
    "subprocess, os, time, re, ast, OrderedDict – for system calls, timing, regex, and ordered dictionaries.\n",
    "3. Reading and Cleaning Input Files\n",
    "get_pdf_links_with_titles(file_path) reads either:\n",
    "Plain text files with lines of ScopusID, Title, Link\n",
    "Or JSON files with {\"title\": {\"scopus_id\":…, \"link\":…}}\n",
    "Extracts the Scopus ID, article title, and ScienceDirect link.\n",
    "Normalizes each link to the canonical form:\n",
    "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/<PII>\n",
    "Returns a dictionary:\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Article Title\": {\n",
    "        \"scopus_id\": \"SCOPUS_ID\",\n",
    "        \"link\": \"ScienceDirect URL\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "4. Aggregating Multiple Files\n",
    "A list of input files (retrieved_links_140000–202947.txt) is iterated over.\n",
    "Each file is parsed into a dictionary and merged into all_pdfs.\n",
    "The total number of unique PDF/article entries is printed.\n",
    "5. Removing Unwanted SCOPUS IDs\n",
    "Loads Remove_Scopus.xlsx into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "Extracts SCOPUS IDs from the second column using a regex (SCOPUS_ID:(\\d+)).\n",
    "Compares these IDs with the batch of articles to flag and optionally remove overlaps.\n",
    "6. Slicing Data into Batches\n",
    "slice_dict(d, start, end) is a helper to process large dictionaries in smaller chunks (e.g., 2,000 entries at a time).\n",
    "7. Safari Automation (macOS Only)\n",
    "The script uses AppleScript via subprocess calls to automate Safari:\n",
    "science_direct_open_pdf_in_safari_and_save(pdf_url)\n",
    "Opens a ScienceDirect article in Safari, waits, clicks inside the page, and triggers the PDF download button using cliclick.\n",
    "clear_history()\n",
    "Clears Safari history periodically to prevent performance issues or popups.\n",
    "new_tab()\n",
    "Opens new Safari tabs as needed for large batches.\n",
    "This approach bypasses login barriers if you’re already authenticated in Safari with your institution credentials.\n",
    "8. File Renaming and Organization\n",
    "After each download, the script:\n",
    "Checks the Downloads folder for newly added PDFs within the last 10 seconds.\n",
    "Cleans the article title for safe filenames (removes special characters).\n",
    "Renames the file as Title-ScopusID.pdf.\n",
    "Falls back to ScopusID.pdf if the title is too long for macOS.\n",
    "9. Handling Missing Entries\n",
    "Compares SCOPUS IDs in the batch vs. already-downloaded PDFs in the output folder.\n",
    "Builds a missing_entries dict of articles still needing download.\n",
    "Loops through these and downloads them via Safari automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####10. Workflow Summary\n",
    "Input: Text/JSON files of ScienceDirect links and an Excel file of SCOPUS IDs to exclude.\n",
    "Parsing: Extract titles, SCOPUS IDs, and links; normalize URLs.\n",
    "Filtering: Remove unwanted SCOPUS IDs.\n",
    "Batching: Slice into manageable sets of 2,000 entries.\n",
    "Download Automation:\n",
    "Open article link in Safari.\n",
    "Click to download PDF.\n",
    "Rename and save into a target folder.\n",
    "Error Handling: Skip failures and continue; print issues for later review.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Key Advantages\n",
    "Scales: Handles hundreds of thousands of entries by batching.\n",
    "Institution Auth: Leverages Safari’s existing login session instead of handling cookies manually.\n",
    "Safe Filenames: Cleans and renames PDFs consistently.\n",
    "Recovery: Tracks missing SCOPUS IDs for re-runs."

    "### Report on PDF Link Extraction and Automated Download Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This pipeline is designed to process large batches of metadata files containing Scopus IDs, article titles, and URLs (primarily from ScienceDirect), extract valid PDF links, filter and clean the data, and automate the downloading and renaming of PDF files using Safari on macOS. It also includes mechanisms to handle missing entries, avoid duplicates, and manage browser history to ensure smooth operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **PDF Link Extraction from Text Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function:** `get_pdf_links_with_titles(file_path)`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Reads a text file where each line contains a Scopus ID, article title, and a URL separated by commas.\n",
    "- **Alternate Function:** A variant of `get_pdf_links_with_titles` reads for file containing 'pdf.sciencedirectassets.com', and fixes them accordinly, this one i created for a few failed files, however it can be combined with the previous function if needed.\n",
    "- **Process:**\n",
    "  - Skips lines with insufficient parts.\n",
    "  - Extracts Scopus ID, title, and link.\n",
    "  - Filters links to only those containing `www.sciencedirect.com`.\n",
    "  - Extracts the PII (Publisher Item Identifier) from the URL using regex and reconstructs a clean ScienceDirect article URL.\n",
    "  - Stores entries in a dictionary keyed by the cleaned title, with values containing Scopus ID and link.\n",
    "- **Batch Processing:** Multiple files are processed sequentially, and their dictionaries merged into a master dictionary `all_pdfs`.\n",
    "- **Outcome:** A consolidated dictionary of unique PDF entries keyed by title.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Data Slicing and Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function:** `slice_dict(d, start, end)` slices the dictionary to process manageable batches (e.g., first 2000 entries).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Enables incremental processing and error isolation.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:** \n",
    "  - Reads an Excel file (`Remove_Scopus.xlsx`) containing Scopus IDs to exclude.\n",
    "  - Extracts IDs using regex and compares with batch IDs.\n",
    "  - Reports any overlaps to avoid processing unwanted or invalid entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Automated PDF Downloading Using Safari and AppleScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions:**\n",
    "  - `science_direct_open_pdf_in_safari_and_save(pdf_url)`: Automates Safari to open a PDF URL, simulate mouse clicks to trigger download, and close tabs.\n",
    "  - `clear_history()`: Clears Safari’s browsing history and cache to prevent interference or rate limiting.\n",
    "  - `new_tab()`: Opens new tabs in Safari to manage multiple downloads.\n",
    "- **Implementation Details:**\n",
    "  - Uses AppleScript executed via `osascript` to control Safari and system events.\n",
    "  - Coordinates mouse clicks at specific screen coordinates using `cliclick` (a command-line tool for mouse control).\n",
    "  - Includes delays to allow page loading and download completion.\n",
    "- **Platform:** macOS-specific automation leveraging Safari and system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Handling Missing Downloads and File Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process:**\n",
    "  - Compares Scopus IDs in the batch with those already downloaded (by parsing filenames in the target folder).\n",
    "  - Identifies missing entries that need to be downloaded.\n",
    "- **Download Loop:**\n",
    "  - Iterates over missing entries.\n",
    "  - Periodically clears browser history and new tabs to maintain performance and avoid blocking.\n",
    "  - Downloads PDFs via the automated Safari script.\n",
    "  - Waits briefly to ensure download completion.\n",
    "- **File Renaming:**\n",
    "  - Renames downloaded PDFs using a sanitized version of the article title combined with the Scopus ID.\n",
    "  - Handles filename length issues by falling back to using only the Scopus.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:**\n",
    "  - Catches and logs exceptions during download and renaming to continue processing remaining entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths of the Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Data Handling:** Supports both text and JSON input formats, enabling flexibility.\n",
    "- **Batch Processing:** Efficiently manages large datasets by slicing and incremental processing.\n",
    "- **Automated Browser Control:** Uses AppleScript and system tools to automate downloads without manual intervention.\n",
    "- **Duplicate and Error Management:** Checks for existing files to avoid redundant downloads and handles gracefully.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning and Validation:** Cleans titles and URLs to maintain consistency and prevent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Areas for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardcoded Screen Coordinates:** The AppleScript relies on fixed mouse click positions, which may break if UI elements or screen resolution changes. Consider using UI scripting with element references or browser automation tools like Selenium for more robust control.\n",
    "- **Platform Dependency:** The current automation is macOS and Safari-specific. For cross-platform compatibility, consider browser automation frameworks.\n",
    "- **Download Verification:** Currently, the script assumes a PDF is downloaded if a new file appears in the Downloads folder. Adding checksum or file size verification could improve reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline effectively automates the extraction, filtering, and downloading of academic PDFs from ScienceDirect using DOIs and metadata. It combines data parsing batch processing, and macOS automation to handle large-scale document retrieval with minimal manual effort. With some enhancements in robustness and scalability, it can serve as a powerful tool for researchers and librarians managing extensive digital collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like, I can also help design improvements, suggest alternative automation approaches, or assist with documentation and testing strategies. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"
